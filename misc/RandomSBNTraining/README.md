# RandomSBNTraining

This is a program to generate random SBN structure (with some control parameters, like number of nodes, states, treewidth) and random training data, in order to run some experiments of parameter learning.


Run *java -jar RandomSBNTraining-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar -h* to print the help.

See [src/main/java/edu/gmu/c4i/dalnim/sbn/Main.java](https://github.com/hjyoon93/iMIA/blob/main/misc/RandomSBNTraining/src/main/java/edu/gmu/c4i/dalnim/sbn/Main.java) for the main entrypoint.
