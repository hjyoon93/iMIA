# RandomSBNTraining

Some source code and scripts to generate random SBN structure (with some control parameters, like number of nodes, states, treewidth) and random training data, in order to run some experiments of parameter learning.

See [src/main/java/edu/gmu/c4i/dalnim/sbn/Main.java](https://github.com/cardialfly/DALNIM/blob/main/misc/RandomSBNTraining/src/main/java/edu/gmu/c4i/dalnim/sbn/Main.java) for the main entrypoint.
