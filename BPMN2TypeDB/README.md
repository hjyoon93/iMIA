# DALNIM BPMN2 to TypeQL converter

Tool to convert BPMN2 files to TypeQL insert scripts, or to load BPMN processes from TypeDB.

See *pom.xml* (the maven configuration file) for details about this project's configuration.

## How to build

1. Download and setup Apache Maven (recommended version 3.8.X) from [https://maven.apache.org/](https://maven.apache.org/).

2. Access (cd) this project's root directory (where the *pom.xml* resides).

3. Run the command below. Make sure you are connected to the Internet because Maven will attempt to automatically download some dependencies.

				mvn clean package

4. An executable JAR file called *BPMN2TypeDB-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar* will be created in the *target* folder. This file can be executed with a Java Runtime Environment (version 11 or newer suggested).
	* Similarly, a source JAR file called *BPMN2TypeDB-<VERSION>-sources.jar* will be created in the *target* folder. This is a standard JAR container with the project's source code. A JAR file is an ordinary ZIP file that can be extracted with any ZIP package extraction tool of your choice.


## How to run

1. Make sure you have a Java Runtime Environment installed (version 11 or above suggested).

2. Run the following command in the console:

				java [-Dlog4j.configurationFile=log4j2.xml] -jar BPMN2TypeDB-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar [COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS]

### Command line arguments
